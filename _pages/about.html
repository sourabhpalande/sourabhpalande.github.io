    I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Michigan State University in the <a href="https://cmse.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE)</a>. Advised by <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/dr_dan_chitwood" target="_blank">Dr. Dan Chitwood</a> and <a href="https://elizabethmunch.com/" target="_blank">Liz Munch</a>, I explore applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), Machine Learning, and Image Analysis to various problems in plant biology.
    <br><br>
    I hold a PhD in Computing (Image Analysis) from University of Utah. My PhD advisor was <a href="https://sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/" target="_blank">Dr. Bei Wang-Phillips</a> and I worked as a graduate research assistant at the <a href="https://sci.utah.edu/" target="_blank">Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute</a>. In my doctoral research, I explored various ways of utilizing topological features of data in machine learning and statistical analysis. A large part of my work was devoted to applying these techniques to study structural and functional brain abnormalities in autism.
    <br><br>
    Before joining the doctoral program at University of Utah, I studied applied mathematics at the <a href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a> in UK, earning a M.Sc. degree with focus on numerical analysis. My master's dissertation, a comparative analysis of various source trajectories in cone beam micro CT, was advised by <a href="http://vummath.ma.man.ac.uk/~bl/" target="_blank">Prof. Bill Lionheart</a>, and funded by industrial collaborators.

    There's a quote by <i>Robert Heinlein</i> describing a competent person that goes like this:
    <blockquote>
      A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
