abstract: 'The Mapper algorithm is a popular tool for visualization and data exploration in topological data analysis. We investigate an inverse problem for the Mapper algorithm: Given a dataset X and a graph G, does there exist a set of Mapper parameters such that the output Mapper graph of X is isomorphic to G? We provide constructions that affirmatively answer this question. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to engineer Mapper parameters to generate a desired graph.'
