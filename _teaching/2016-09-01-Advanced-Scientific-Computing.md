<p>
    This was a graduate level course intended to give students exposure to the algorithms and implementations often used in scientific computing. Students were assumed to have had some previous experience in numerical methods (such as in an introductory numerical analysis or scientific computing course) or in a numerical ODEs course. However, formal prerequisites only required  knowledge of basic calculus, linear algebra, and ODEs. Specifically, in this course, we touched upon the following topics:
    <ul>
        <li>Nonlinear equations in one variable.</li>
        <li>Computational linear algebra (direct and iterative methods).</li>
        <li>Eigenvalues and singular values.</li>
        <li>Nonlinear systems and optimization.</li>
        <li>Interpolation and approximation.</li>
        <li>Numerical integration and differentiation.</li>
    </ul>
    This course was to be followed by a second advanced graduate course that focused on the numerical solution of partial differential equations (CS 6220: Advanced Scientific Computing II).
